      <p>How We Rock & Roll</p>
      <h2>Process</h2>

      <div id="stepone">
        <h3>STEP 1: Help us get to know your project.</h3>
        <p>Whether you’re an emerging indie rock idol focused on developing your merch sales, a venue manager looking to attract larger crowds or an introspective sound designer seeking the visibility you need to gain access to licensing opportunities, we take the time to understand what you do and where you want to go.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="steptwo">
        <h3>STEP 2: The right channels, the right style, the right strategy</h3>
        <p>It is great that there are so many avenues to promote your project these days, but the number of options can make your head spin. We will design a custom strategy that targets the best platforms for your goals and celebrates the unique awesomeness of your music or organization.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="stepthree">
      <h3>STEP 3: Great musicians keep reaching until they hit the perfect note, and so do we</h3>
      <p>We monitor outcomes obsessively and are never satisfied until our efforts yield career-changing results for the wonderful people who place their trust in us. If our initial strategy doesn’t pan out as we expected, we will not hesitate to “change keys,” and to keep doing so until you see a payoff.</p>
